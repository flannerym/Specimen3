## Early Herbarium Specimen

This specimen is in a bound herbarium dating to 1595, about 50 years after the first herbaria were created.  An herbarium is a collection of preserved plant material; most are dried plants made by pressing cuttings between sheets of absorbent paper and kept flat until they are dry.
